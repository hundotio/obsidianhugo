# Obsidian to Hugo transfer script!

This is my little transfer script for uploading blogposts from Obsidian to Hugo :)

If you want to use this script yourself, change the following variables in the program (use explicit paths!):

- **obsidianBlogs** - the path to blogs within your Obsidian vault
- **obsidianImages** - the path to imagse within your Obsidian vault
- **hugoBlogs** - the path where blogs are uploaded to Hugo (likely going to be /content/posts)
- **hugoImages** - the path where images are uploaded to Hugo (I use /static/images)
- **githubPath** - the path where this repo is cloned
